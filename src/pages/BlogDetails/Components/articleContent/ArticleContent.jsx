          Most teams treat information architecture as a post-launch cleanup
          task. In reality, the way you structure your data defines the ceiling
          of your product's operational efficiency.

        <h2>The Cost of Silent Entropy</h2>
        <p>
          When we talk about "ops brain," we aren't just talking about
          automation triggers. We are talking about the semantic layer of your
          company. Every SaaS team starts with a clean Slack and a clean Stripe.
          Within six months, the debt begins. "Pro" in Stripe means something
          different than "Verified" in HubSpot. The signals don't match, and the
          automation breaks.

        <h2>Mapping the Decision Chain</h2>
        <p>
          At Synkra, we've analyzed over 14 million runs across 2,400 teams. The
          most successful teams don't have more complex automations; they have
          more explicit playbooks. They've mapped their information architecture
          so that an event in GitHub translates perfectly to a notification in
          Slack without translation layers.
        </p>
        <blockquote className={styles.quoteTwo}>
          "Data architecture is not about databases, it's about decision
          architecture.It's about making sure the right data flows to the right
          place at the right time."

        <h2>Structuring for Scale</h2>
        <p>
          The transition from a 3-person team to a 50-person product org is
          where most information architectures collapse. Tribal knowledge is the
          enemy of automation. When your PM can't look at a playbook and
          understand exactly why a deal was routed to a specific owner, you
          haven't built a system—you've built a riddle.
